# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Titanic Dataset
## Objective
Perform EDA to understand patterns, correlations, and insights from Titanic passenger data.

## Steps Taken
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Analyzed feature relationships using correlation matrix and pairplot
- Observed categorical feature impact on survival (Sex, Embarked)
- Used Plotly for an interactive sunburst chart

## Libraries Used
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Plotly Express

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher class and lower fare were associated with better survival
- Strong correlation between family size and survival probability
